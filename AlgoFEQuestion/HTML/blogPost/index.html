            <h1> What is a blog post?
            </h1>
            <p>
                A blog post is any article, news piece, or guide that's published in the blog section of a website. A
                blog post
                typically covers a specific topic or query, is educational in nature, ranges from 600 to 2,000+ words,
                and contains
                other media types such as images, videos, infographics, and interactive charts.

            <h2>Content Management System</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>CMS (content management system)</strong> is a software application that allows users to build
                and maintain a
                website
                without having to code it from scratch. CMS platforms can manage domains (where you create your website)
                and
                subdomains <em>(where you create a webpage that connects to an existing website)</em>.
                Once you have your domain name set up, customize the appearance of your blog to reflect the theme of the
                content you
                plan on creating and your brand.

            <h2>Visual Appearance</h2>
            <p>
                No one <a href="https://algoexpert.io" target="_blank">Algoexpert</a> likes an unattractive blog post. And it's
                not just pictures that make a post visually appealing —
                it's the formatting and organization of the post, too.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a well-formatted and visually-appealing blog post, you'll notice that header and sub-headers are used
                to break up large blocks of text — and those headers are styled consistently.
